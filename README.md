# Ola-Play-Studios

---

This project was created for Ola-Play-Hiring-Challenge on hackerearth.com <br>
The time duration for the challenge was 12 hours.

<ul>
The features completed in this app include : 
<li>Use of Web API to fetch songs details. [Fetched using volley library]</li>
<li>Visually interactive design to list details. [Used Recyclerview with customised cardview]</li>
<li>Add Search to the list screen to search for songs by name. [Done by filtering the results in the recyclerview]</li>
<li>Implement song download functionality to device. [The songs will be downloaded in a directory called "Ola Play Studios" and if the song is already present there, duplication wont happen means the song wont be stored again.]</li>
</ul>

The time was mostly spent in learning about downloading a file and debugging the errors in and around it.

I took help from the following resource online : 
<a>http://www.androhub.com/android-download-files-save/</a>

<ul>
Future features which can be added :
<li>Music Player Integration to stream songs</li>
<li>Possible extension to video streaming</li>
</ul>
